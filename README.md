### Library System

- This is a simple programme which simulates a real life library system
- The main purpose of this program is to practice C# through the implementations of:
		- Dependency Injection (DI) via interfaces
		- Separation of Concerns (UI vs. business logic)
		- SOLID principles (SRP, DIP)

Features:
1. Borrow/return books with availability checks
2. Donate new books (duplicate prevention)
3. View available/unavailable books
4. Mock services support (e.g., BrokenBookService for testing)
